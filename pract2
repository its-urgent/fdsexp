'''
Write a Python program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a
transaction log from console input. The transaction log format is shown as following: D
100 W 200 (Withdrawal is not allowed if balance is going negative. Write functions for
withdraw and deposit) D means deposit while W means withdrawal.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
D 300
D 300
W 200
D 100
Then, the output should be: 500
'''

b=0
print("balance = ", b)
while True:
    d=int(input("1 for deposite and 2 for withdrawal and 3 for display balance : "))
    if d==1:
        a=int(input("amount to d : "))
        b+=a
    elif d==2:
        a=int(input("amount to withdraw : "))
        if b>=a:
            b-=a
        else:
            print("low balance!!!")
    elif d==3:
        print(b)
