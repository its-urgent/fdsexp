/*Queues are frequently used in computer programming, and a typical example is the
creation of a job queue by an operating system. If the operating system does not use
priorities, then the jobs are processed in the order they enter the system. Write C++
program for simulating job queue. Write functions to add job and delete job from queue.*/
